Leaflet
=======
Leaflet is a modern, lightweight BSD-licensed JavaScript library for making tile-based interactive maps for both desktop and mobile web browsers, developed by [CloudMade](http://cloudmade.com) to form the core of its next generation JavaScript API.

It is built from the ground up to work efficiently and smoothly on both platforms, utilizing cutting-edge technologies included in HTML5. Its top priorities are usability, performance and small size, [A-grade](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/) browser support, flexibility and easy to use API. The OOP-based code of the library is designed to be modular, extensible and very easy to understand.
