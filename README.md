Leaflet
=======
Leaflet is a lightweight JavaScript library for map display and interaction by [CloudMade](http://cloudmade.com). It will form the core of CloudMade's next generation JavaScript API.

It is built from the ground up to work well on both desktop and mobile web browsers, utilizing cutting-edge technologies included in HTML5. It's main priorities are usability, performance, [A-grade](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/articles/gbs/) browser support (up to IE6), flexibility and easy to use API. The OOP-based code of the library is designed to be modular, extensible and very easy to understand and modify.
